# Jacob Robinson - Product Engineer (Frontend-focused)

Hey! I'm Jacob, a frontend-focused product engineer who's spent the last 8+ years building complex web applications, internal platforms, and tools that people depend on.

Currently exploring agentic development and MCP-based workflows for rapid prototyping and internal tooling.

## What I'm Building

🏠 [Property Ranker](https://property-ranker.vercel.app/) - Geospatial property comparison tool using UK Police API, Just Eat proximity, and Turf.js

🚗 [TrackAtlas](https://www.trackatlas.co.uk) - UK track day aggregator with automated scraping across 7 providers

🎮 Game Server Browser - Next.js dashboard integrating Contentful, Pterodactyl, and GameDig with SWR polling

🏎️ AutoRaider - Browser extension that enhanced AutoTrader listings (RIP after markup changes)

## Tech Stack

Frontend-led but comfortable working across the stack:
```javascript
describe('Jacob Robinson', () => {
  test('Core Stack', () => {
    const frontend = ['TypeScript', 'React', 'Next.js', 'Vite', 'Tailwind'];
    const testing = ['Jest', 'Cypress', 'MSW', 'Playwright'];
    const backend = ['Node.js', 'Python/FastAPI', 'Neon Postgres'];
    const tooling = ['Nx', 'Vercel', 'GitHub Actions'];
    
    expect(dailyWork).toContain(...frontend, ...testing);
    expect(sideProjects).toContain(...backend);
    expect(devExperience).toInclude(...tooling);
  });

  test('Working Knowledge', () => {
    const exposure = ['Kotlin/Spring Boot', '.NET Core', 'GraphQL'];
    expect(canOnboardOnto).toEqual(expect.arrayContaining(exposure));
  });
});
```

Currently at Allica Bank building internal case-management platforms and AI-assisted tooling.
