# Jacob Robinson - Product Engineer (Frontend focus)

Hey there! I'm Jacob, a passionate product engineer with a love for crafting digital experiences.

I'm currently experimenting with agentic development for POC projects.

## What I'm Up To

🚗🏁 UK track day aggregator with automatic updating for most major providers [TrackAtlas](https://www.trackatlas.co.uk)

🏎️🧑‍🏫 Sim racing coach with live prompts utilising Second Monitor for telemetry exports

## Tech Stack

Frontend? Backend? I've got them both covered! Here's how my skills align:

```javascript
describe('Jacob Robinson', () => {
  test('Tech Stack', () => {
    const frontendTech = ['JavaScript', 'TypeScript', 'React', 'Next.js', 'Redux'];
    const backendTech = ['Node.js', 'Express', '.NET Core'];
    
    expect(techStack.frontend).toEqual(expect.arrayContaining(frontendTech));
    expect(techStack.backend).toEqual(expect.arrayContaining(backendTech));
  });

  test('Learning Wishlist', () => {
    const expectedSkills = ['Python', 'Go', 'Kotlin'];
    expect(learning.skills).toEqual(expect.arrayContaining(expectedSkills));
  });
});
```

Connect with me and let's build something amazing together!
